At this point it's still very early in the process. I have my own coding style
and I'd prefer to try to mimic it as much as possible. I have a small to do list
setup in the [wiki](https://github.com/steveno/balistica/wiki/To-Do); please take 
any of the tasks you want, but please also file a ticket so I know you're working on it.
