## Contributing
At this point it's still very early in the process. I have my own coding style
and I'd prefer to try to mimic it as much as possible. If that's not helpful enough use [Yorba's](http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/yorba/wiki/CodingConventions) coding style. 
It's close enough to mine.

I have a small to do list setup in the [wiki](https://github.com/steveno/balistica/wiki/To-Do); please take
any of the tasks you want, but please also file a ticket so I know you're working on it.

As always please file any and all bugs.
