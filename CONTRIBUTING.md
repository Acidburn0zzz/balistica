## Contributing
At this point it's still very early in the process. I have my own coding style
and I'd prefer to try to mimic it as much as possible. Here the highlights:
 1. Always use tabs
 2. No trailing spaces 
 3. The opening brace goes on the same line `if (var = 1) {`

A good place to start if that isn't enough for you is to just use the coding style from [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9).

I have a small to do list setup in the [wiki](https://github.com/steveno/balistica/wiki/To-Do); please take
any of the tasks you want, but please also file a ticket so I know you're working on it.

As always please file any and all bugs.
