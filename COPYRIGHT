Large parts of the program though have been more or less 
directly lifted from other programs under a different license.
As far as I know all the code I didn't write is legal for me
to use in my program. If someone feels differently please let 
me know.

Many of the files in this directory were originally part of The 
GNU Ballistics Calculator (GBC) written by Derek Yates. It was
licensed under the GNU GPL version 2. Each file converted from 
GBC is noted at the top of the file after the license header.

sql/data/fill_bullets.sql
Was originally from from saballistics which is licensed under

cmake/FindGit.cmake
I found this guy somewhere on the internet. I'm not 100% of It's license 
is listed here: http://www.slicer.org/pages/LicenseText 
Probably should swap this guy out for something with a license I 
understand like the one here github.com/djkabala/KabalaEngine
which is licensed under GPLv3. It appears to do everything I need.
