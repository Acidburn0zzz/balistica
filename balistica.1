.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBctags\fP and \fBetags\fP programs (hereinafter collectively referred to
as \fBctags\fP, except where distinguished) generate an index (or "tag") file
for a variety of language objects found in \fIfile(s)\fP.
This tag file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text
editor or other utility. A "tag" signifies a language object for which an
index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index entry created for that
object).

.SH "OPTIONS"

Despite the wealth of available options, defaults are set so that \fBctags\fP
is most commonly executed without any options (e.g. "ctags *", or "ctags \-R"),
which will create a tag file in the current directory for all recognized
source files. The options described below are provided merely to allow custom
tailoring to meet special needs.

.TP 5
.B \-a
Equivalent to \fB\-\-append\fP.

.TP 5
.B \-B
Use backward searching patterns (e.g. ?pattern?). [Ignored in etags mode]

.SH "CAVEATS"
Because \fBctags\fP is neither a preprocessor nor a compiler, use of
preprocessor macros can fool \fBctags\fP into either missing tags or
improperly generating inappropriate tags. Although \fBctags\fP has been
designed to handle certain common cases, this is the single biggest cause of
reported problems. In particular, the use of preprocessor constructs which
alter the textual syntax of C can fool \fBctags\fP. You can work around many
such problems by using the \fB\-I\fP option.
