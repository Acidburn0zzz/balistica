        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Balística is a exterior balisitics calculator with some extra feature tacked on. The program is named for the <a href="http://translate.google.com/#en/ca/ballistics">Catalan word</a> for "ballistics".</p>
<p>Currently the project is in it's very early stages and is still missing quite a few features I've planned for it. Feel free to jump in and help!</p>

<h2>Current Features</h2>
<h3>Miller Twist Rule</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_twist_rule/">Miller Twist Rule</a> is a mathematical formula dervised to help people calculate which bullets will work better in thier rifle based upon various factors. Including bullet length and barrel twist rate.</p>

<h3>Greenhill Forumlua</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_George_Greenhill/">Greenhill Formula</a>, in the same vien as the Miller Twist Rule is a much older formula for the same purpose that has been used for centuries now. It is the defacto standard for this type of computation.</p>

<h2>Planned Features</h2>
<h3>A front end (GUI)</h3>
<p>I really want a GUI front end. I'd like to have a layout that promotes ease of use and can be learned quickly without having to write RTFM everywhere.</p>

<h3>A database to store custom handloads in</h3>
<p>I want to be able to create and store custom hand loads. I already have a SQL database strucutre worked out for this. I also have some basic data to load in it. But that's all I have. I don't even have Vala to talk to the database with.</p>

<h3>Calculate using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics#Fixed_drag_curve_models_generated_for_standard-shaped_projectiles">standard drag functions</a> G1-G8</h3>
<p>The standard drag functions are an essential part of any wana-be ballistics program. It's a have-to-have.</p>

<h3>Seperate actual ballistics software into library</h3>
<p>I'd like to have a <strong>LibBalistica</strong> so that people could theoretically use the same math in other programs. Or at the very least expand upon this one with little trouble.</p>

<h3>Check out the code yourself:</h3>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/steveno/balistica.git</code></pre>

<h3>Minimum Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a> 0.18.0</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/waf/">Waf</a> 1.6.11</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>At this point I'm the author and only contributor. Having said that though I must clarify that I have been converting the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/balcomp/">GNU Exterior Ballistics Computer</a> by Derek Yates to Vala in order to get started. The program is open source and licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 so nothing fishy is going on. If you are Mr. Yates or know him I'd love to talk to him. I have no idea why he did a lot of what he did and I'd like to comment at least my version so it can be explained to myself and future users.</p>
