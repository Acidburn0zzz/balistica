        <h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>In the simplist terms, balística is an open source ballistics calculator. More specifically, balística is a exterior balisitics calculator 
with some extra features tacked on. The program is named for the <a href="http://translate.google.com/#en/ca/ballistics" target="_blank">Catalan 
word</a> for "ballistics".</p>

<p>Currently the project is in it's early stages and is still missing quite a few features I have planned for it. Feel free to jump in and help!</p>

<h2>Current Features</h2>

<h3>Calculate using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics#Fixed_drag_curve_models_generated_for_standard-shaped_projectiles" target="_blank">standard drag functions</a> G1-G8</h3>
<p>The standard drag functions are an essential part of any ballistics program. It is simply a have-to-have. Currently balística has the backend
built out for this, but the GUI front end to is still a work in process.</p>

<h3>Miller Twist Rule</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_twist_rule" target="_blank">Miller Twist Rule</a> is a mathematical formula dervised to help
people calculate which bullets will work better in thier rifle based upon various factors. Including bullet length and barrel twist rate.</p>

<h3>Greenhill Forumlua</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_George_Greenhill" target="_blank">Greenhill Formula</a>, in the same vien as the Miller Twist
Rule is a much older formula for the same purpose that has been used for centuries now. It is the defacto standard for this type of computation.</p>

<h2>Features In Process</h2>

<h3>GUI for Standard Drag Functions</h3>
<p>This is very close to completion and should be done very soon!</p>

<h3>Seperate actual ballistics software into library</h3>
<p>I'd like to have a <strong>libbalistica</strong> so that people could theoretically use the same math in other programs. Or at the very least
expand upon this one with little trouble. The code for this backend has already been seperated out in the git repository, but it needs configured
so that it truely is a seperate peice of software.</p>

<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<h3>A database to store custom handloads in</h3>
<p>I want to be able to create and store custom hand loads. I already have a SQL database strucutre worked out for this. I also have some basic data
to load in it. But that's all I have. I don't even have Vala to talk to the database with.</p>

<h3>Expansive Help Pages</h3>
<p>I don't want to rewrite Wikipedia, but I'd really like to have a nice in depth look at whats going on in the software and how to properly use and
understand the software in the help pages. The help pages do exist in a fleshed out form but need a lot of work expanding them out to be useful.</p>

<h3>Other minor features</h3>
<p>There are a lot of calculations out there! While I don't expect balística to be able to calculate <em>all of them</em> I see no reason to not try and
do as many as possilbe. I'm sure there are a lot of still very realvent ones out there I haven't even started yet.</p>

<h2>Helping out</h2>
<h3>Check out the code</h3>
<pre style="background-color: #3d3d3d;"><code><span style="color: #87ceeb;">~</span><span style="color: #cd5c5c;">$</span> <span style="color: white">git clone git://github.com/steveno/balistica.git</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>Building</h3>
<pre style="background-color: #3d3d3d;">
<code><span style="color: #87ceeb;">~</span><span style="color: #cd5c5c;">$</span> <span style="color: white">cd balistica</span>
<span style="color: #87ceeb;">~/balistica</span><span style="color: #cd5c5c;">$</span> <span style="color: white">mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build</span>

<span style="color: #87ceeb;">~/balistica/build</span><span style="color: #cd5c5c;">$</span> <span style="color: white">make install</span></code>
</pre>

<p>I'd prefer pull requets though Github to keep it simple, but patches through email are always welcome anyway.</p>

<h3>Minimum Build Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://live.gnome.org/Vala" target="_blank">Vala</a> 0.20.1</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_blank">Cmake</a> 2.8</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/" target="_blank">glib-2.0</a> 2.32</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gtk.org/" target="_blank">gtk+-3.0</a> 3.6.0</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>At this point I'm the author and only contributor. Having said that though I must clarify that I have been converting the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/balcomp/">GNU Exterior Ballistics Computer</a> by Derek Yates to Vala in order to get started. The program is open source and licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 so nothing fishy is going on. If you are Mr. Yates or know him I'd love to talk to him. I have no idea why he did a lot of what he did and I'd like to comment at least my version so it can be explained to myself and future users.</p>
